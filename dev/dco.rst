Guide to the Developer Grant and Certificate of Origin
======================================================

Things To Consider Before Contributing to the Project
*****************************************************

To help with understanding what's required to contribute to Forj, we are providing guidance on why the Project has made certain decisions.

* The Project has selected the Apache 2.0 license, popular for its permissive and flexible properties, while still encouraging a collaborative community.
* The Project has selected an approach to contributions inspired by the popular Linux Developer "Certificate of Origin". This approach makes it simple for new contributors to get started, and avoids bureaucracy in tracking contributions and contributors. 
* To indicate accordance, each contributor must validate accordance on `Forj's Gerrit`_:
	* Go to `Forj's Gerrit`_ then to Settings / Agreements / New Contributor Agreement / DCO
	* Review carefully the agreement, if you agree, enter "I AGREE" in the box, and click "Submit agreement"


Agreeing to the DCO means that you state that the following are true of your contribution:

* I created this contribution/change and have the right to submit it to the Project; or
* I created this contribution/change based on a previous work with a compatible open source license; or
* This contribution/change has been provided to me by someone who did (a) or (b) and I am submitting the contribution unchanged.
* I understand this contribution is public and may be redistributed as open source software.
* I understand that I retain copyright ownership in this contribution and I am granting the Project a copyright license to use, modify and distribute my contribution. The Project may relicense my contribution under other OSI-approved licenses.

.. note::

 You must confirm the nature of your contribution with the actual certificate and license language.
 
Why are we including the final paragraph which is not part of the Linux DCO?
****************************************************************************

Under the Apache Software License v2.0, each contributor provides a copyright license for their contribution to all licensees of the Project. The Project includes some source code files, which originate under other OSI-approved licenses compatible with the Apache license. Modifications to such files will typically be licensed by the Project under the original open source software license.

In some cases the Project may need to relicense your contribution under other OSI-approved open source licenses in order to maintain the Apache-based licensing. For example, if your contribution is affected by GPL v2 code, the Project may dual-license your code under both Apache 2.0 and GPL v2 or LGPLv2.1. This satisfies the GPL requirements, while still allowing other users to make use of the code under Apache.
