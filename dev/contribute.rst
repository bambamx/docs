Contributing
============

Code
****
Take a look at our `issue list`_ and consider submitting a patch. You may have a look at our "fruits" issues (from the low hanging kind) to get started.
Consider contributing code, documentation and :term:`blueprint` (fixes to existing, or brand new blueprints).

Forj's code development process mimics the one used by the OpenStack project. If you are an OpenStack contributor, you will feel at home.
