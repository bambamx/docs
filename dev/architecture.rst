============

High level architecture

Forj Blueprint catalog is hosted by HP, leveraging "HP CSA - Cloud Services Automation". If you are an enterprise, this allows you to run your own HP CSA and expose CI/CD stacks as a service for your R&D teams. You do not have to run HP CSA to create a forge. You can use the :ref:`"forj command line" <install-cli>` to create CI/CD environments.
