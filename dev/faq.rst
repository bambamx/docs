  Amongst the possibilities, you could sign up for an HP Cloud account and use Forj's portal to provision your forge there. Last time we checked, HP Cloud offered `$300 credit over a period of 3 months <http://www.hpcloud.com/cloud-credit>`_. Enough to host an "A la OpenStack" forge for free for 3 months.
