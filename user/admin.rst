Administration
==============

You administer a forge through the Maestro user interface. This includes:

* General forge administration (health, backup & restore, :term:`take home`)
* Project administration
* Tool administration 
* User administration

.. note::
	Currently, the Maestro user interface is not completed. The configuration is done through a special project on Gerrit called :term:`forj-config`.
