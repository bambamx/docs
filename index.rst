Welcome to Forj!
================
Forj is a mean for software developers to get a continuous integration stack which is working out of the box, and can be installed anywhere in minutes. That kind of environment is often refered to as a `forge <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_(software)>`_, a collaboration platform for software developers.

Forj is Open Source (see the :doc:`/license`) and provides:

* A collection of pre-integrated continuous integration and delivery tool stacks called blueprints
   * Forj has currently one continuous integration stack which mimics the Openstack |trade| Open Source project. We look forward to build a Forj community to add many continuous integration stacks to the catalog.
* An orchestration and administration component called *Maestro* which provides a uniform way to provision projects and users as well as manage the forge (backup/restore, monitoring, updates).
